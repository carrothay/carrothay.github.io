# [Java] Big O

Chapter: Section 5

Time Complexity: A way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of input increases.

### Big O Notations

- Big O: a complexity that is going to be less or equal to the worst case, **O(N)**
- Big Omega: at least more than the best case, **Ω(1)**
- Big Theta: within bounds of the worst and the best cases, **Θ(n/2)**

### Runtime Complexities

1. O(1) - Constant: Any assignment statements and if statements that are executed once regardless of the size of the problem

2. O(N) - Linear: A simple “for” loop from 0 to n ( with no internal loops)

3. O(N^2) - Quadratic: A nested loop of the same type takes quadratic time complexity

4. O(LogN) - Logarithmic: A loop, in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step

5. O(2^N) - Exponential
