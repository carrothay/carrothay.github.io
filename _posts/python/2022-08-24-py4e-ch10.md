# ch10. Tuples

### Tuples

- similar to lists but Tuples are immutable
- take up less storage and are quicker to access than lists
- used for “temporary variables”
- sort, append, reverse, … methods are not allowed
- Tuples are comparable

```python
z = ( 1, 9, 2 )
print(z)
# (1, 9, 2)

(x, y) = (4, 'fred')
print(y)
# fred
(a, b) = (99, 98)
print(a)
# 99

(0, 1, 2) < (5, 1, 2)
# True 값을 가집니다.
```
